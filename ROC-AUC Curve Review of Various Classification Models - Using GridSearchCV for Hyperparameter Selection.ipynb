    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For the classification portion of this project, I decided on using the in-vehicle-coupon-recommendation data set from UC Irvine. The goal of this data set is to determine whether an individual will accept a coupon that's recommeneded to the individual, in different driving scenarios. In order to accurately determine whether a coupon was to be accepted, I decided to use KNN, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Kernelized Support Vector Machine, and Linear Support Vector Machine classification models. In addition, I decided on going with the AUC-ROC curve as my main classification evaluation strategy, rather than accuracy, for several reasons.\n",
    "\n",
    "The reason for using the AUC-ROC curve, was because the ROC curve is the graphical representation of the true positive rate of a classifier plotted against the false positive rate of a classifier. Since the area under the curve is the measure of the ability of a classifier to distinguish between classes, I decided that it'd be a great determiner of the quality of each model's predictions. For these reasons, the AUC score would be a more suitable evaluation strategy than accuracy. In addition to this, various tuning parameters were applied to each model and GridSearchCV was used to loop through hyperparameters, in order to effectively select the best parameters for the models."

    "\n",
    "For data preprocessing, the only item adjusted prior to placing np.nan values into our data, was the removal of the column 'cars', as it had only 108 non-null values. The lack of values in this column, made it impossible to decipher what the make up of the column's values could be. Therefore, the column was dropped.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "In addition to this, 16,007 null values were added to the data set, to allow for preprocessing practice, which accounted for 5% of the 317,100 total values in the data set. The nulls were spread across 8 separate columns, which contained categorical and numeric variables. Histograms were then used to evaluate distributions of values in columns to decide what method would be best for imputing the null values. After having imputed each column, one-hot encording was then used to modify categorical data. As most of the data consisted of categorical data, one hot encoding increased the dimensionality of the feature set from 25 columns to 108 columns. Despite this large jump in feature columns, I believed the increase would allow a further glimpse into the nuance within the dataset, thereby allowing a more accurate prediction of coupon acceptance.\n"

This may be due to the fact that the dataset has a wide variety of factors and demographics within it, which could account for the large number of k being an alright fit.\n"

    "In conclusion, the best fitting classification model that was tested was also the longest model to run, which was the Kernelized Support Vector Machine, using the rbf kernel, with gamma=0.1, and C=1. The orginal use of GridSearchCV() for the kernel svc model ran for over an hour and the result was worth the wait, as the best scoring model had a 0.819 area under the ROC curve, which was the highest ranking of all the models. The second best model was KNN, with an area under the curve of 0.774 and this was followed by one of the decision tree classifier, with an area under the curve of 0.741. Overall, I was pleased with the relative effectiveness of the SVM model in this starter project, and the evaluation method that was used to compare each model. \n"
